# TestRepo-Collaboration
Testing area to learn features and functionalities in GitHub repositories.

##This is a dummy test for some very basic integrations features in Github. It is not about the code itself.

### Java dummy (= dumb!) code uses *Servlet1*, *Servlet2*, *Servlet3* from *TestinaDiServlets* package.
To launch it (assuming you copiled a war, and set it up in zour local web server, etc.. ) just browse the index.html (http://localhost:8080/TestinaDiServer/)

*Please Note: This test is doing nothing but logging something ...*
